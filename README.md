# Strategic Financial Modeling for Mid-Cap Investments

This project covers credit risk modeling, asset monitoring dashboards, portfolio rebalancing, and revenue forecasting for mid-cap APAC investment analysis.

## Summary

Objective 
• Conduct financial analysis and research to support investment decisions across APAC mid-cap firms

Approach 
• Applied logistic regression on 15,000+ credit profiles to model default risk and optimize exposure limits  
• Built dashboards using Python and Excel to monitor asset allocation across 6 investment verticals  
• Proposed rebalancing using Sharpe ratio and volatility targeting to optimize portfolio efficiency  
• Forecasted revenue using ARIMA and modeled uncertainty using Monte Carlo simulations

Results 
• Boosted expected portfolio yield by 12% over benchmark allocations through strategic rebalancing  
• Reduced revenue forecast variance by 25% via time series modeling and scenario-based sensitivity analysis
